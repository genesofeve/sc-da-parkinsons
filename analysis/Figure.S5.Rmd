Figure S5 is composed of plots rendered during the running of weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). The links below lead to sections of the [P7 WGCNA Analysis code](WGCNA-final.html).

* [Figure S5A](WGCNA-final.html#heirarchial_clustering_of_cells)  
A sample dendrogram after removal of outliers with regional identity for each cell displayed below the plot

* [Figure S5B](WGCNA-final.html#choosing_a_soft_threshold)  
Scale independence and mean connectivity plots that allowed us to determine the "soft threshold" setting we would need for the analysis

* [Figure S5C](WGCNA-final.html#relationships_between_modules)  
A dendrogram of the module eigengenes identified in our analysis
