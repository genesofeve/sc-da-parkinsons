Since Figure 5 involved scripts that were long for individual panels and some panels were found in other analyses, this link page was created.

* [Figure 5A](Figure.5A.html)
* [Figure 5C](Figure.5C.html)
* [Figure 5E](Cplx1_Th-striatum_analysis.html#visualization)
This links to a boxplot that shows the comparison of _Th_+ striatum staining between WT and _Cplx1_ KO mice
